# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Kerf** is a browser-based CAD-style editor for **CNC-ready cut drawings**, plus an MCP server so Claude can draw, edit and preview the same documents live with the user. 1 unit = 1 mm everywhere.

Projects are saved as **`.kerf`** (JSON: layers, elements, entities, 3D placements, parameters, material, reference image). **SVG, DXF, per-part files, PNG, GLB and STL are exports.** SVG and DXF files can also be opened or imported.

It is being used to design a plywood sit/stand desk. That project lives in `data/desk/`: `generate.py` (the parametric source, it also writes `desk.kerf`), `DESIGN.md` (the spec) and reference photos. `For CNC.dxf` there is **only for a final comparison, never a design source**.

## Running & testing

```bash
docker compose up -d --build        # editor at http://localhost:8765, MCP (SSE) on :8766
docker compose run --rm --no-deps -T --entrypoint python kerf -m pytest -q tests   # server + MCP tool tests
python3 data/desk/generate.py --push   # regenerate the desk and (re)open it in the editor
```

- `web/` and `data/` are bind-mounted: edit the UI and reload the page. Python changes need `--build`.
- Rebuilding restarts the server. Claude Code's MCP connection must then be reconnected (`/mcp`). Open tabs and unsaved work survive in `data/.session.json`.
- No build tools or JS dependencies. The UI is plain ES modules. The 3D preview loads three.js from cdn.jsdelivr.net.

## Architecture

**The server is the single source of truth.** The browser sends operations and renders the state the server returns, kept live by long-polling. It never pushes whole documents, because that caused reloads to overwrite work in the past.

```
mcp-server/
  document.py  Document model: Layer (colour, line style, lock, export, description, depth),
               Element (id, tag, layer, attrs, text, group), Group ("entity": name, parent, qty,
               assembly), params, material. SVG read/write ("file" / "cnc"), .kerf (to/from_native).
  store.py     Store: open documents as Tabs (file, dirty fingerprint, undo/redo, selection),
               apply(ops) = one atomic undo step, files in data/, session autosave, screenshots.
  layout.py    parts on the drawing: reposition() (move/transform keeping assembly matrices in sync),
               default_matrix, pieces(), arrange() (MaxRects onto SHEETS), layout_issues (overlap, too
               close, off sheet), assembly_report (world boxes, clashes by sampling part solids).
  export.py    SVG geometry → DXF (ezdxf; LWPOLYLINE with arc bulges, CIRCLE), DXF → SVG import,
               per-entity part files + zip (nesting software), bounding boxes.
  server.py    MCP tools + HTTP API (aiohttp) — thin wrappers over Store.
  kerf_script.py  stdlib-only helpers for parametric generator scripts: Drawing (whole project as one
               batch: parts, 3D placement, expect() world-box checks, arrange, run() CLI), HTTP calls,
               outlines with fillets/dog-bones/arcs, place() → drawing mapping + matrix, world_box;
               served at GET /api/script so remote Claude sessions can use it. Local generators import it.
  guide.md     the design guide (get_guide, /api/guide); its Parametric scripts example is run by tests.
  tests/       pytest: test_store.py (model/store/exports), test_tools.py (MCP tools),
               test_script.py (kerf_script + the guide example), test_layout.py (moves keep 3D,
               named refs, arrange, layout checks, clashes)
web/js/
  state.js     client state, event bus, entity helpers (itemAt, descendants, selectItems, context)
  api.js       HTTP client; mutations serialized; long-poll sync; background image cache
  geometry.js  layer styling, doc→SVG/PNG, moveAttrs, bboxes
  canvas.js    render, zoom/grid/rulers, tools: select (entities, drill-down, marquee), pan, draw
               (drag or click–click + typed dimensions), text, measure (snaps) ; selection dims
  panels.js    Layers (depth, export, …), Entities tree, Inspector (shape / entity + 3D placement /
               document + Material & stock)
  actions.js   file (tabs, Open/Save As browser, computer files), import/export, edit, entities
  menu.js      menus (File/Edit/View/Layer/Export), toolbar, tool palette, shortcuts
  tabs.js      document tabs + 3D preview tabs
  preview3d.js three.js assembly: extrude entities (CUT_OUTSIDE outline, CUT_INSIDE holes,
               pockets from layers with depth), place with assembly, sliders, GLB/STL export
  materials.js material presets
  main.js      wiring: state → views, status bar, code panel, side panel, selection sync, screenshots
data/          projects (*.kerf), imports (.svg/.dxf), exports/, .session.json (gitignored)
```

### Model rules
- **Stroke colour and line style belong to the layer** (CNC colour convention). Element attrs never carry `stroke`, `stroke-dasharray`, `data-layer`, `data-group`, `style` or `id`. Attribute names are validated (no namespaces, no `on*`).
- A layer with a **`depth`** is a partial-depth cut from the top face (a pocket). Without one it's a through-cut. **Only `export` decides what goes into CNC exports** (NOTES and HARDWARE don't); visibility is just a view setting.
- **Everything loaded is validated** (`Document.sanitize`, used by `.kerf`, sessions and SVG import): layer names/colours/line styles/depths, element ids/tags/attributes, entity ids/parents/assemblies (`clean_assembly`), parameters (`clean_params`). Keep new fields going through it — file data reaches the UI.
- **Entities** (groups) may span layers, so a part is its outline plus its holes. They nest through `parent`; the UI enters them with double-click, and Esc goes up. `qty` is used for part exports.
- **`assembly`** (per entity) places the part in 3D:
  - `matrix [a,b,c,d,e,f]` maps doc 2D → part-local 2D (y up). Omitted in update_group: kept, or for a new
    placement the drawing's bottom-left corner (`"auto"` recomputes). The `move`/`transform`/`arrange` ops
    compose it with the inverse move, so moving a part on the sheet never moves it in 3D. The browser's
    drag and nudge use the `move` op for that reason; don't move parts with raw update_element.
  - `thickness` is the extrusion along local +Z; the top face at z = thickness is the router face, where pockets are cut.
  - `rotation` is in degrees (Euler XYZ); `position` is in world mm (X width, Y up, Z toward the viewer).
  - optional `color`, and `move: {param, axis}` tied to a doc `params` slider.
  - Opposite-hand parts with pockets must be drawn mirrored (see the desk's lower frame B).
- Older `.svgcnc` files (the format's first name) still open; saving writes `.kerf`.
- `material` holds name, type, thickness, colour, sheet size, tool Ø and notes. It supplies the default thickness and colour in 3D.

### Store / sync
- All edits go through `Store.apply(ops)`: the browser always names its tab, and MCP tools use the active tab. Within a batch, `"$n"` in items/id/ids/group/parent refers to the result of op n, and `"$name"` to the op with `"as": "name"`, so a whole part (shapes + group) is one undo step. Errors say which op failed. Ops:
  - elements: `add_element, update_element, remove_elements, reorder_element`;
  - layers: `add_layer, update_layer, set_layer_visibility, remove_layer, move_layer`;
  - document: `set_size, set_background(_opacity), clear, replace_svg, import_svg, set_material, set_params`;
  - entities: `group, ungroup, update_group, set_group` (move items into an entity or out of it);
  - layout: `move {items,dx,dy}`, `transform {items,transform}`, `arrange {sheet_width,sheet_height,margin,gap,rotate,notes}`;
  - `set_title` (the project name).
- Undo/redo and dirty tracking are per tab. Visibility is view state: not undoable, doesn't make the file dirty.
- `dirty` means the content fingerprint differs from the last save/open. Rapid single-field edits coalesce into one undo step.
- Each state response carries the active tab's doc. The reference image is only an id; the image itself comes from `GET /api/background`.
- `selection` per tab: the browser reports it (`POST /api/selection`). Claude sets it through MCP (`selection_seq`), and the browser then highlights and zooms to it.
- Files are resolved inside `data/` only.

### HTTP API (port 8765, this machine only)
The compose file publishes both ports on 127.0.0.1 only. The `local_only` middleware rejects other Host headers (DNS rebinding), foreign Origins and non-JSON POSTs (cross-site forms). The MCP SSE server has FastMCP DNS-rebinding protection turned on.

- **State:** `GET /api/state[?since=V&instance=I]` (long-poll).
- **Editing:** `POST /api/ops {ops,label}` · `POST /api/undo|redo`.
- **Files and tabs:** `POST /api/file/new|open|close|activate|revert|save|saved-local|mkdir|delete|import` (import takes `svg | dxf (base64) | project`) · `GET /api/files` · `GET /api/browse?folder=`.
- **Exports:** `GET /api/export/{cnc|cnc-dxf|parts|file|project}`.
- **Scripts:** `GET /api/script` (kerf_script.py) · `GET /api/check?tab=` (check_cnc for any tab) · `GET /api/assembly?tab=` (describe_assembly). `add_layer` takes `exist_ok` (update instead of failing) so generators can re-run.
- **Other:** `POST /api/selection` · `POST /api/screenshot` · `GET /api/background` · `GET /api/guide`.

## MCP tools (server `kerf`, SSE on :8766)

The server also sends workflow instructions to the client (`INSTRUCTIONS` in server.py).

- **Projects/tabs:** `get_document_info, list_documents, list_files, list_tabs, switch_tab, new_document, open_document, save_document, close_document, revert_document, set_project_name, set_canvas_size, set_material, undo, redo`
- **Guide:** `get_guide(topic)`: workflow, layers, 3D placement recipes, CNC rules (also `GET /api/guide`, Help → Kerf guide). Keep `mcp-server/guide.md` up to date when conventions change.
- **Elements:** `list_elements, add_element, add_svg` (many shapes at once, one undo step), `update_element, remove_element, set_element_layer, move_elements, transform_elements, duplicate, reorder, clear_document, get_svg`
- **Entities/3D:** `list_groups, group_elements, ungroup, update_group` (name, qty, assembly), `move_to_entity`, `set_params`, `describe_assembly` (world boxes, clashes)
- **Sheets:** `arrange_parts` (pack pieces onto sheets, SHEETS layer, notes block; 3D unchanged)
- **Layers:** `list_layers, add_layer, update_layer, remove_layer, move_layer` (with `depth` for pockets)
- **Measure/selection:** `measure, add_dimension, get_selection, set_selection`
- **Import/export:** `import_dxf, export_cnc` (svg|dxf), `export_svg, export_parts`
- **Power tools:** `apply_ops` (any ops, one call, one undo step, `"as"`/`$name` references), `find_elements` (by layer/tag/entity/area), `describe_entity` (bounds, hole sizes, layers, world box), `check_cnc` (open contours, holes smaller than the tool, duplicates, text on cut layers, parts bigger than the sheet, overlapping/too close/off-sheet parts, warnings for parts not in 3D, …)
- Tool arguments take real JSON (objects, id lists); JSON strings and comma-separated ids still work.
- **Preview:** `take_screenshot(view="2d"|"3d"|"3d-exploded")` (async; needs the editor open in a browser), `set_background_image, remove_background_image`
- **Prompts:** `design_part(description)`, `prepare_for_cutting`

### Working with MCP
1. `get_document_info` / `list_tabs`. Never discard the user's unsaved work or close their tabs without asking.
2. Use layers, not colours: outlines → CUT_OUTSIDE, holes/slots → CUT_INSIDE, pockets → a layer with `depth`, labels/dimensions → NOTES, bought parts → a non-export layer.
3. Build each part with one `apply_ops` batch (shapes + `group` via `"as"`/`$name`, `fill="none"`, then `update_group` with `qty` and `assembly {rotation, position}`), so part exports and the 3D preview work. Big or parametric designs: a kerf_script `Drawing` script.
4. `arrange_parts` onto the sheets.
5. `check_cnc` and `describe_assembly`, then `take_screenshot` (2d and 3d). `save_document` writes the .kerf. Use `export_cnc(format="dxf")` / `export_parts` for the shop.

## SVG/DXF for CNC guidelines
- 1 unit = 1 mm; exports carry mm units. Don't scale in CAM.
- Draw nominal geometry; kerf and tool offsets are CAM's job (CUT_OUTSIDE = outside offset, CUT_INSIDE = inside offset, pockets = pocket operation at the layer depth).
- Inside corners get the tool radius; add dog-bones where a square part must fit.
- Closed shapes with no gaps, no duplicate overlapping lines, text converted to paths before engraving, no gradients/clips/effects.
